# 3D Interactive Portfolio

A modern, immersive portfolio website showcasing creative web development skills through interactive 3D experiences.

## Project Description

I built this interactive portfolio to showcase my skills in modern web development while creating something visually stunning. The project combines React and TypeScript with Three.js to create immersive 3D environments throughout the site - from floating crystals and energy beams in the hero section to animated particle systems in the background.

I used GSAP for smooth animations and scroll effects, making everything feel fluid and responsive. The 3D scenes include interactive elements that respond to mouse movement and even audio input, with post-processing effects that give it that sci-fi glow. The whole thing is built with Tailwind CSS to ensure it looks great on any device.

What I'm most proud of is how I organized the code with custom React hooks and modular components, making it both performant and maintainable. It's not just a portfolio - it's a demonstration of what's possible when you combine creativity with solid technical skills.
